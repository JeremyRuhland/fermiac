The [FERMIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FERMIAC) is a mechanical computer from the 1940's which was used to run monte carlo simulations of neutron transport inside nuclear reactors.

These design files can be used to create a functioning replica.

DXFs were created in LibreCAD 2.0.9, FCSTD and STLs made in FreeCAD v0.17
